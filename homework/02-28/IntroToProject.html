        <h2>Hello World!</h2>
        <h3>About the Dataset</h3>
        <p>The dataset I found profiles 4,100 private sector buisnesses that use inmate labor. The spreadsheet has fields like:
            <ul>
                <li>Company Name</li>
                <li>Primary Sector</li>
                <li>Annual Revenue</li>
                <li>Correction Facility Association</li>
                <li>& more</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3>Potential Visualization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One option would be a map of the US that displayed that displayed all the states that provide inmate labor.
                <br> Using mouse over actions and tool tips the viewer of the visualization would see what buisnesses use labor 
                <br> out of those states. Additionally the viewer would be able to see the average wage inmates in those states get.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Another option would be a visualization of the buisnesses logos that are arange in a bubble chart with their size being
                <br> proportional to the revenue they recive from inmate labor. When the user mouses over or clicks on the logo they would see
                <br> other statistics like the numerical value of the revenue, the states in which the labor is provided, 
                <br> the average wage inmates in those states get, and industry/production information, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
