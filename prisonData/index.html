          Hundreds of thousands of businesses around the world user prison labor to help support their revenue. 
          The graph above shows 1370 businesses and compares their annual revenue in the millions between 2004 and 2020.
          Companies like Amazon, AT&T, IBM, McKinsey & Company and many more make millions. An article from Yale's Institution for Social and 
          Public Policy writes that "According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, federal inmates earn 12 cents to 40 cents per hour
          for jobs serving the prison, and 23 cents to $1.15 per hour in Federal Prison Industries factories." Some states like Alabama pay 
          inmates nothing for their labor. This money is often used by inmates in the commissary to buy things like:
          <ul>
            <li>Food (chips, soda, tea, soup, etc)</li>
            <li>Clothing (shirts socks, thermal clothing, undergarments, etc)</li>
            <li>Personal hygiene items (shaving cream, hair brush, deodorant, shampoo, dental supplies, etc)</li>
            <li>Personal Items (pens, paper, books, stamps, religious items, etc)</li>
            <li>etc</ul>
          </ul>
